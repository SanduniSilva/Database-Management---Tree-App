# Database-Management---Tree-App

Scenario:

<p align="justify">TreeApp is a not-for-profit social startup that wants to accelerate reforestation by using 
technology. They are developing an app, where anyone can register and upload pictures of the 
trees they have planted, with other information such as description, date, geo location etc. When 
they upload trees, the app will ask for the tree type first and the user can select it from a list. User 
can also add more photos periodically to show how the tree grows. Based on these information, 
the TreeApp will show a map of trees planted by all users. Additionally, the users will get points 
based on the number of trees they plant and a number of years they look after them, and Badges 
(displayed on their profile) based on their achievements.</p>
